<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org103ef36">
<p>
Our Business venture focuses around an app for your phone that would allow you to efficiently organize your tasks into a schedule and reduce distractions caused by your phone. The Calendar will not take pre-determined work periods
like most other calendars do; rather you insert the deadline of projects as well as times within the week when you are free to work, and the app creates a schedule to get work done <i>for</i> you. Additionally, Social Media apps and
distractions will be locked off, and educational tools will be provided to instill good habits. There will also be a reward system for remaining consistent.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org6703d63">
<p>
We are excellent Entrepreneurs because we found an idea that already has a saturated market, but one we intend to innovate upon, using our imagination and understanding of the struggles many go through while trying to organize
their lives. We understand the needs of the people, and with our perseverance and goal-setting, we’ll create an app to help the lives of others. An app such as this one would need effort to realize, but we are two very hardworking
people and with the right resources it is possible to benefit the lives of many with even just a simple calendar app while turning over considerable profits.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org40b9b7a">
<p>
The business wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily need a location for an office; it can be online-based, and our team can connect to and interact with one another fully digitally in a work-from-home format. This job would perfectly suit that.
Working online is cheaper and more practical for the manner in which our business operates because we will not have to rent out an office space, nor will we have to meet physically, meaning our employees can even come from
overseas, keeping practicality at an all time high in our specific situation. Furthermore, managing schedules entirely online is perfect because we can set up meetings or presentations anywhere anytime. In addition to being
cheaper and more practical, our business will open to every nation for workers who can communicate in English, and as a result, we can be more culturally aware and make business decisions with those different perspectives in
mind, as well as advocating for equality and cultural diversity among other things.

<h4 id="org899e1b7">Logo Design Explanation</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org899e1b7">
<p>
Our logo has 3 key aspects that show a unique identity that makes us stand out. First, we have a symbol in the center of our logo that resembles a clock that is both half-clock and half-gear. In regards to our product, which
serves to maximize productivity time, the clock is only natural because we associate it with time in all aspects. However, the gear is a bit more abstract, because a gear is commonly only part of a machine, but it also
represents progress, things are moving forward and the metaphorical gears in your brain are moving, signifying productivity. Another aspect of the logo is the messy circle behind this half-clock half-gear hybrid symbol, which
represents the messy mind or work ethic we are aiming to rectify with this app, which means that the symbol juxtaposes the circle behind it. This contrast is important because you will be attracted to the bright orange of the
circle first, then to the symbol, signifying the transition from a messy mind to a productive, time-efficient mind. Finally, we have a simple text placed on a victorious ribbon, which is self-explanatory. The ribbon represents
a victory or a reward, which is what your brain will be presented with once you start using this app. Then, on the ribbon, we have the name of the app in addition to the slogan just underneath, simply notifying the customer
the basic information of this product.

<h4 id="orgb9807c7">Product or Service?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgb9807c7">
<p>
Our business will offer a service. We will create and maintain an app called Celacrity that helps users manage their busy lives with scheduling tools, study tools, and there will be a paid subscription model for access to
on-demand help such as Tutors if needed
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org693dd67" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org693dd67">Competitive Considerations</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org693dd67">
<p>
Our service will be convenient because it will be sold both on computers and on mobile devices with special attention placed on creating an easily navigated interface. As opposed to competing Calendar apps, we’d like to have a
system with automatic suggestions on how to schedule your time working on projects that will be due soon, with a reward system for consistently staying on task. We’re thinking of a digital pet and plant collection that will
grow over time as you continue keeping up your dedication to the schedule. Additionally, distractions such as social media will be forcibly kept out of your way so you can stay on task, and tools to provide assistance with
your task on hand will also be provided (I.E. a Calculator, explanatory YouTube videos, on-demand Tutors for a cost, etc.)
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org41c8fd3" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org41c8fd3">Direct Competition</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org41c8fd3">
<p>
Our biggest competitors would be other Calendar and organization apps; such as Google and Apple Calendar, Microsoft To Do, although they wouldn’t quite align with the feature-set we’re hoping to provide. Another example
wouldn’t be a paid product, but it would perhaps be Emacs’ Org Mode or Markdown Documents as they offer similar means of organization and outlining projects; though this would need to be done completely manually, which is
something we’re hoping to mitigate. Another big competitor I can think of would be the Forest app, which similarly provides a reward system to motivate the user into remaining focused on their work.

<h4 id="org9e4a3df">Impact on community</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org9e4a3df">
<p>
Our business will generate wealth through a subscription based model with multiple tiers of subscriptions varying in prices with differing quantities of benefits and tools based on your subscription choice. Through the tools
our service offers, we will generate on-demand based tutoring jobs and use a rating system that will help people globally earn money for tutoring students and how well they do it, ensuring there are no bad tutors. In doing
this, our business will generate income for a community that is not physical, which is the tutoring/educational community, allowing us to sponsor and help out other education tools in the process. In addition, we can slowly
adopt other tools as we grow and partner up with them to add to the subscription, creating a high value product that trivializes any competitors, essentially creating a monopoly.

<h4 id="org140b7a1">Business Ownership type</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org140b7a1">
<p>
We would prefer for our Business to be a General Partnership. This is because this Business venture is between two people; Harrison and Arad, and a Partnership is the best way to divide the revenue and liabilities. It would
technically mean a smaller Owner’s Equity for the both of us, however it is important to have people who are on the same wavelength who can individually bounce off each other&rsquo;s ideas in addition to the employees to improve the
service.

</li>

<li><a id="org3ab8990"></a>Employee Satisfaction<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org3ab8990">
<p>
Employee satisfaction will come from flexibility, independence and regular opportunities to express your feelings and opinions. However, this is especially important considering the fact that our team will never be on a
corporate level in terms of size, so keeping employee satisfaction high is something we will always be able to focus on. Furthermore, the flexibility will come from flexible hours, and employees will be entitled to their own
independence and be trained with self-sufficiency in their projects, but this does not mean they will not collaborate, as that is a crucial aspect to the success of an app. Finally, during meetings and such, we strive to be
inclusive and encourage having fun so we are open to ideas, suggestions and listening to personal struggles or opinions on how to improve the app. Overall, our main focus is maintaining the morale of the workplace, ensuring
everyone is happy and heard regardless of their identity or the lack of a physical space to communicate in.

<h4 id="org00b452c">Our Marketing Strategy</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org00b452c">
<p>
As to go along with our primary form of development being online, so will our marketing. Search engines such as Google offer advertising services in order to keep your results at the top of search results pages, and we could
employ this method of advertising. If someone goes on Google and searches “Calendar/Organization tool” then our result would be amongst the first to show up. Additionally, we could make use of traditional banner advertising on
the side of websites, as well as sponsoring YouTube videos so as to attract a percentage of their viewers to our app. Finally, we’ll need to provide for spaces in order to talk about, spread the word about, and provide
feedback regarding our app. This could be in the form of accounts on Social Medias, or perhaps a Subreddit to have discussion surrounding our app.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orga8e8696" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orga8e8696">Presentation of merchandise</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orga8e8696">
<p>
We will present our app in app stores and on our websites with flashy images and text, bright eye-catching colours and short, but sweet lines of text that are attractive to viewers and make bold claims. In doing this,
customers will see the bright colours, glance over, and in that short time period in which we have their attention, they’ll read text that gets them intrigued along with a link at the top of app description that will
immediately send them down a rabbit hole of researching the product. Furthermore, even if a person doesn’t subscribe to the app, the simple act of searching it up or knowing about it will end up it becoming more common in
autofill results on search engines like Google or through being spread by word of mouth, such as if someone is talking to their friend and they say something along the lines of“I haven’t been productive lately, it’s been
really detrimental to my mental health,” so the person who saw our app will go, “I saw an app a while back and it made some big promises, maybe you should try that.”

<h4 id="org42ca571">Market research</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org42ca571">
<p>
The people who would make use of our app the most would be those leading busy lives who find it preferable to schedule their workflows to handle it better. This is a wide demographic, but it can be broken down. For instance,
it’s almost certain that our app would be used primarily by those in higher grades of elementary school and older. Particularly, those in Secondary and Post-Secondary education would likely find the Tutoring Network our app
would offer to be especially valuable. Their income levels can vary; the app will have both a free tier for many of the basic features the app will offer, and a subscription model for advanced features such as the
aforementioned Tutoring Network.

Our app would be provided to our consumers in the form of the most popular App Stores. This would include the Apple App Store for iOS, macOS, and iPadOS, the Google Play and Amazon App Stores for most Android devices,
potentially F-Droid if we decide to make our app open source, as a web application, and as Electron (or something similar) applications for other Desktop operating systems such as Linux and Windows.

<p>
We do not require any form of raw materials because we will all work remotely on computers and other technologies in order to formulate our service. However, for capital, each person would need to be individually equipped with
their own technologies that they use for work, which are primarily computers, tablets and phones, but some people may also need their own physical possessions that aid them in working efficiently. In regards to human
resources, we will simply require workers such as software developers, web developers and marketing experts to help us with any given aspect of the company because the main workings of the company revolve around software and
the marketing strategies to get more people to use it.

<div id="outline-container-org600b893" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org600b893">How we will invest the $25k Reward into our Business</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org600b893">
<p>
Our business is not one with many expenses. We would not need any form of raw materials, no office spaces as everyone can most certainly work remotely, and so the biggest upfront cost would be hiring staff with the requisite
qualifications and providing them with devices they&rsquo;ll be needing in order to code if necessary. While we could hire our own Marketing and Finance departments, since we&rsquo;re a small enough company, this could also be outsourced
to dedicated Marketing and Accounting firms. According to Glassdoor, Software Developers get paid an average of $81,533 annually in Toronto which would be an average of about $6794/month per Developer. With even an incredibly
small team of 4 of them, that becomes $27,176/month for human resources. That&rsquo;s not even to mention the potential costs of providing devices for these employees; if we were to simply give them Chromebooks and ask them to use
Visual Studio Code online for the least expensive option, that&rsquo;s still at least $400 per device. $25k would go an incredibly long way towards kickstarting our Business, therefore, but we&rsquo;d need to begin seeing profits quickly
and expand our Business likely past just a single app as well.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org34a2918" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org34a2918">Regarding additional Financing</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org34a2918">
<p>
We would almost certainly need to get additional financing on top of our $25k prize in order to start our Business. A small Software Company is not one with many expenses they need to manage all at once typically, but
hiring qualified Developers, outsourcing to Finance and Marketing firms, and potentially providing for needed devices is going to be a very big upfront cost. Because of this, we would also need to pursue <b>debt financing.</b>
This is because Equity Financing would initially mean we wouldn&rsquo;t owe any person a monetary amount, however allowing for someone to gain a share of our entire Business may prove to be catastrophic later down the line. We have
an innovative idea which we could potentially release to the public in only a matter of months. While debt financing is always logically set <i>against</i> you with the Interest rates; proving to be a recipe for Bankrupcy if not
planned correctly, our Business could pay off the debts in very quick time. We would need - as an estimate - around $10k more in order to comfortably have a starting point for our Business.
