<h2 id="orgc929898">What is our Business Venture?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc929898">
<p>
Our Business venture focuses around an app for your phone that would allow you to efficiently organize your tasks into a schedule and reduce distractions caused by your phone. The Calendar will not take pre-determined work periods
like most other calendars do; rather you insert the deadline of projects as well as times within the week when you are free to work, and the app creates a schedule to get work done <i>for</i> you. Additionally, Social Media apps and
distractions will be locked off, and educational tools will be provided to instill good habits. There will also be a reward system for remaining consistent.
</p>
</div>

<h2 id="org3e26450">TV Station Script</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org3e26450">
<p>
We are excellent Entrepreneurs because we found an idea that already has a saturated market, but one we intend to innovate upon, using our imagination and understanding of the struggles many go through while trying to organize
their lives. We understand the needs of the people, and with our perseverance and goal-setting, we’ll create an app to help the lives of others. An app such as this one would need effort to realize, but we are two very hardworking
people and with the right resources it is possible to benefit the lives of many with even just a simple calendar app while turning over considerable profits.

<h3 id="org6e52e91">Brief Introduction and summary: Harrison</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org6e52e91">
<p>
This report is about Celacrity, a new app that aims to revolutionize and innovate the way people manage their busy lives. Celacrity is an all-purpose study app that combines many features including music playlists, study tools,
tutors and restricting social media in order to keep users organized and productive with their time. Celacrity is designed to be easy to use and has a user friendly interface, with the focus being centered on simplicity and
optimizing time accompanied by a reward system that rewards you based on your commitment to your schedule. At Celacrity, we have ensured that the workplace is friendly, free of distractions, diverse and welcoming to people from
all walks of life.

<h4 id="orgd32d380">Location of the business: Harrison</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgd32d380">
<p>
The business is online-based because we only work on apps using digital tools. Therefore, our team is able to connect and interact with one another with the required technology right in front of them anywhere in the world.
This approach is cost-effective and practical because working online would eliminate the need to rent out an office space, and also allows us to create a diverse workforce composed of employees from everywhere in the world as
long as they can communicate in English. As a result, we will be able to be more culturally aware and make business decisions that reflect our values and varying perspectives. In addition to our finances and values, working
from anywhere in the world is practical for employees who go on trips frequently, seeing as they will be able to work if they must and allows us to set up important meetings with our employees regardless of where they are. The
drawbacks to our online-based business is that there will be an inevitable lack of human interaction that may take a toll on employees’ productivity and mental health as well as their ability to socialize.

<h4 id="org79c8773">Logo Design Explanation: Arad</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org79c8773">
<p>
Our logo has 3 key aspects that show a unique identity that makes us stand out. First, we have a symbol in the center of our logo which is a clock that is half-clock and half-gear. Elaborating further, the clock half
represents the concept of time and how our product will optimize it. However, the gear represents a more abstract concept because it represents progress. A gear represents the fact that things are progressing and the
metaphorical gears in your brain are spinning, signifying productivity. Another aspect of the logo is the messy circle behind the symbol, which represents the messy mind that juxtaposes the symbol of productivity in the middle
and the work ethic we are aiming to rectify with this app. This contrast is important because you will be attracted to the bright orange of the circle first, then to the symbol, signifying the transition from a messy mind to a
productive, time-efficient mind. Finally, we have a simple text placed on a victorious ribbon, which is self-explanatory. The ribbon represents a victory or a reward, which is what your brain will be presented with once you
start using this app. Then, on the ribbon, we have the name of the app in addition to the slogan just underneath, simply notifying the customer the basic information of this product in order to provide the information needed
for the customer to research the product..

<h4 id="org47a6d8a">Product or Service?: Arad</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org47a6d8a">
<p>
Celacrity will offer a service. We will create and maintain an app named Celacrity that offers a comprehensive, user-friendly and efficient tool to help people manage their busy lives. With the scheduling and study tool
provided, there will be a paid subscription model for access to on-demand help from tutors.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org469a6cc" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org469a6cc">Competitive Considerations: Arad</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org469a6cc">
<p>
To make the business competitive in the market, we will prioritize the many aspects of convenience, degree of service, selection, reputation and prices. Celacrity is convenient because it will be sold both on computers and on
mobile devices with special attention placed into an easily navigated interface for both platforms. Furthermore, unlike other calendar apps in this niche, we will have a system with automatic suggestions on how to schedule
your time working on upcoming projects and deadlines, with a reward system for consistently staying on task. For a reward system, we will provide a digital pet and plant collection that will grow over time the longer you stay
dedicated to your schedule. Additionally, distractions such as social media will be forcibly kept out of your way so you can stay on task, and tools to provide assistance with your task on hand will also be provided (I.E. a
Calculator, explanatory YouTube videos, on-demand Tutors for a cost, etc.) that help give us a competitive edge over our competitors.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org6119283" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org6119283">Direct Competition: Arad</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org6119283">
<p>
Our biggest competitors would be other Calendar and organization apps; such as Google and Apple Calendar, Microsoft To Do because they wouldn’t align with the feature-set we’re hoping to provide. Another example wouldn’t be a
paid product, but it would be Emacs’ Org Mode or Markdown Documents as they offer similar means of organization and outlining projects; though this would need to be done completely manually, which is something we’re going to
help avoid and simplify. Another big competitor would be the Forest app, which similarly provides a reward system to motivate the user into remaining focused on their work.

<h4 id="orgd465414">Impact on community: Harrison</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgd465414">
<p>
Our business will generate wealth through a subscription based model priced at $10/month with a significantly higher quantity of benefits and tools based on your choice between the premium subscription and the free
subscription. Through the tools our service offers, we will generate on-demand based tutoring jobs outside of the subscription with tutors selected by Celacrity that will help people earn money globally by tutoring students,
which means that there will be no bad tutor. Also, in order to make the tutoring lucrative, we will take a small amount of 10% of the profit they earn from their commissions. In doing this, our business will generate income
for a community that is not physical, which is the tutoring/educational community, allowing us to sponsor and help out other education tools in the process. In addition, we can slowly adopt other tools as we grow and partner
up with them so we can add them to the subscription, creating a high value product that trivializes any competitors, essentially creating a monopoly.

<h4 id="org86400b8">Business Ownership type: Arad</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org86400b8">
<p>
We would prefer for our Business to be a General Partnership. This is because this business venture is between two people; Harrison and Arad, and a partnership is the best way to divide the revenue and liabilities. It would
technically mean a smaller Owner’s Equity for the both of us, however it is important to have people who are on the same wavelength who can individually bounce off each other&rsquo;s ideas in addition to the employees to improve
Celacrity. The drive and passion to create an all-purpose study app trumps the need for maximizing profits over quality and greediness. Therefore, a partnership would allow us to optimally function because the combined
perspectives and experiences of two people who work well together is essential in order to create an exceptional product.

<li><a id="org64e185b"></a>Social responsibility in the community<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org64e185b">
<p>
Our social responsibility in the community will come from supporting productivity and education, which helps everyone around the world in streamlining the work process and teaching people to enjoy learning.
</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a id="orgfc5caf4"></a>Employee Satisfaction<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orgfc5caf4">
<p>
Employee satisfaction will stem from flexibility, independence and regular opportunities to express your feelings and opinions. However, this is especially important considering the fact that our team will never be on a
corporate level in terms of size, so keeping employee satisfaction high is something we will always be able to focus on. First, the flexibility will come from flexible hours, and employees will be entitled to their own
independence and be trained with self-sufficiency in their projects, but this does not mean they will not collaborate, as that is a crucial aspect to the success of an app. Next, during meetings and such, we strive to be
inclusive and encourage having fun so we are open to ideas, suggestions, listening to personal struggles and taking into account opinions on how to improve the app and workplace. Finally, in addition to our goal for personal
well being, we will eventually include a wellness program to keep employee mental health in tact. Overall, our main focus is maintaining the morale of the workplace, ensuring everyone is happy and heard regardless of their
identity or the lack of regular human physical interaction.

</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgc954799" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgc954799">Our Marketing Strategy: Harrison</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgc954799">
<p>
Our marketing and sales strategy will focus on reaching our target audience through digital channels such as social media and search engine optimization. Our goal for search engine optimization is for when someone goes on
Google and searches “Calendar/Organization tool”, our result would be amongst the first to show up. In order to accomplish this, we will need to garner popularity and provide a reason for our target audience to search us up
and begin putting us into autofill queries. Therefore, we plan on garnering popularity through digital advertising that will at the very least encourage the viewer to do a quick google search of the company, which is all we
need in the beginning. Additionally, as our profits begin to rise, we will make use of traditional banner advertising on the side of big websites like YouTube, as well as sponsoring YouTube content creators so as to attract
their viewers to our app. Consequently, we will concentrate on selecting the right content creators with an audience similar to our target audience to sponsor, allowing us to receive the maximum amount of attention from people
who care. Finally, we’ll need to provide spaces for people to discuss Celacrity, spread the word about, and provide feedback regarding our app. This could be in the form of accounts on Social Medias, or perhaps a subreddit on
Reddit revolving around Celacrity or making posts about Celacrity on study/education/productivity related subreddits to start discussions surrounding our app.

<h4 id="org23a1f99">Presentation of merchandise: Arad</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org23a1f99">
<p>
We will present our app in App Stores, and on our websites with flashy images and text, bright eye-catching colours and short, but sweet lines that are attractive to viewers and make bold claims. In doing this, customers will
glance over everything, and they’ll read text that gets them intrigued along with a link at the top of app description that will immediately send them down a rabbit hole of researching the product. Furthermore, even if a
person doesn’t subscribe to the app, the simple act of searching it up or knowing about it will end up it becoming more common in autofill results on search engines like Google or through being spread by word of mouth, such as
if someone is talking to their friend and they say something along the lines of “I haven’t been productive lately, it’s been really detrimental to my mental health,” so the person who saw our app will go, “I saw an app a while
back and it made some big promises, maybe you should try that&#x2026;”

<h4 id="orgfdab9cf">Market research: Arad</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgfdab9cf">
<p>
The people who would make use of our app the most would be those leading busy lives who find it preferable to schedule their workflows to handle it better. This is a wide demographic, but it can be broken down. For instance,
it’s certain that our app would be used primarily by those in higher grades of elementary school and older. Particularly, those in Secondary and Post-Secondary education would likely find the Tutoring Network our app would
offer to be especially valuable. Moreover, the income levels of the customers can vary; the app will have both a free tier for many of the basic features the app will offer, and a subscription model for advanced features such
as the aforementioned Tutoring Network and digital pet and plant collection.

Our app would be provided to our consumers in the form of the most popular App Stores. This would include the Apple App Store for iOS, macOS, and iPadOS, the Google Play and Amazon App Stores for most Android devices,
potentially F-Droid if we decide to make our app open source, as a web application, and as Electron (or something similar) applications for other Desktop operating systems such as Linux and Windows.

We do not require any form of raw materials because we will all work remotely on computers and other technologies in order to formulate our service. However, for capital, each person would need to be individually equipped with
their own technologies that they use for work, which are primarily computers, tablets and phones, but some people may also need their own physical possessions that aid them in working efficiently. In regards to human
resources, we will simply require workers such as software developers, web developers and marketing experts to help us with any given aspect of the company because the main workings of the company revolve around software and
the marketing strategies to get more people to use it.

<h4 id="org506c7bc">How we will invest the $25k Reward into our Business: Harrison</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org506c7bc">
<p>
Our business is not one with many expenses. We would not need any form of raw materials, no office spaces as everyone can most certainly work remotely, and so the biggest upfront cost would be hiring staff with the requisite
qualifications and providing them with devices they&rsquo;ll be needing in order to code if necessary. While we could hire our own Marketing and Finance departments, since we&rsquo;re a small enough company, this could also be outsourced
to dedicated Marketing and Accounting firms. According to Glassdoor, Software Developers get paid an average of $81,533 annually in Toronto which would be an average of about $6794/month per Developer. With even an incredibly
small team of 4 of them, that becomes $27,176/month for human resources. That&rsquo;s not even to mention the potential costs of providing devices for these employees; if we were to simply give them Chromebooks and ask them to use
Visual Studio Code online for the least expensive option, that&rsquo;s still at least $400 per device. $25k would go an incredibly long way towards kickstarting our Business, therefore, but we&rsquo;d need to begin seeing profits quickly
and expand our Business likely past just a single app as well.

<h4 id="orgc85ee46">Regarding additional Financing: Harrison</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgc85ee46">
<p>
We would almost certainly need to get additional financing on top of our $25k prize in order to start our Business. A small Software Company is not one with many expenses they need to manage all at once typically, but
hiring qualified Developers, outsourcing to Finance and Marketing firms, and potentially providing for needed devices is going to be a very big upfront cost. Because of this, we would also need to pursue <b>debt financing.</b>
This is because Equity Financing would initially mean we wouldn&rsquo;t owe any person a monetary amount, however allowing for someone to gain a share of our entire Business may prove to be catastrophic later down the line. We have
an innovative idea which we could potentially release to the public in only a matter of months. While debt financing is always logically set <i>against</i> you with the Interest rates; proving to be a recipe for Bankruptcy if not
planned correctly, our Business could pay off the debts in very quick time. We would need - as an estimate - around $10k more in order to comfortably have a starting point for our Business.
